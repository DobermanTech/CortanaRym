How to install -- Simple Version:
You'll need Python installed on the machine
Download zip, extract all
from that folder on a windows machine, run the "Run CortanaRym.bat"
  that will attempt to install pygame. if it crashes or fails the first time after installing pygame, run it again. 


Once pygame is installed, start the game however you want via the main.py file
  command line "python 'main.py' "
  Run CortanaRym.bat
  using VS Code like the kiddie that I am

Who has two thumbs and made a game?
